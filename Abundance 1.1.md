Abundance Update 1.1 is making progress! It's not quite to the point where we can show off a lot of this stuff ingame yet but you can expect to see plenty of showcases in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/VzXSCFp) as it continues to be developed.

In the meantime, here's the planned changes in the update. Lots of new features - this is the biggest update a Team Aurora mod has ever had, dwarfing even Fruitful 2.0!

# Tweaks, Retextures, and Removals
- Almost the entire mod has gotten a fresh look! The textures are much more on-par with how our textures usually look nowadays.
- Jacaranda Trees are a bit less square and should look a little nicer now.
- Non-flowering Jacarandas now have a few small flowers budding on them.
- Lavender now spawns naturally fully-grown, which should save you on some tick lag and make the Lavender Fields look a bit nicer.
- Saguaro Cacti have been removed from the mod. An update to Better Badlands adding them to that mod will be released concurrently with this one.
# Daisies
- African Daisies have been removed because of the addition of several new types of daisies.
- Pink, Purple, and Magenta Daisies generate in Lavender Fields & Lavender Forests (with the purple & magenta ones being more common).
- Yellow, Orange, and Red Daisies generate in Sunflower Plains.
- Blue Daisies generate in Meadows (more on that later).
- All daisies generate in Flower Forests.
# Tropical Plants
- New flowers: Myosotis, Heliconias, and Fiddlenecks now generate in tropical biomes.
- Not necessarily tropical but Myosotis can also generate in Meadows.
- Tropical Grass & Tropical Ferns generate in tropical biomes, replacing regular Tall Grass & Ferns.
- Tunbergia Jungle Trees now generate! These yellow flowering variants of Small Jungle Trees tend to be found next to lots of flowers. They drop Yellow Blossoms if Atmospheric is installed.
# Coffee
- Coffee Shrubs now generate in Savanna biomes. They can be used to get, you guessed it, coffee! Specifically, they drop Coffee Seeds and Coffee Beans, and can be planted with Coffee Seeds if you'd like.
- Coffee Beans can be roasted. You can then craft them into Brown Dye.
- Roasted Coffee Beans can also be crafted into Ground Coffee, which can then be made into Coffee. Coffee gives a currently unnamed effect that keeps the insomnia timer in place for the duration, and makes Phantoms neutral. Coffee also comes in Mocha and Chicory variants.
- Ground Coffee can be used on flowers to grow them into their tall variants as a shockingly useless side feature.
# Chicory Changes
- Chicories no longer spawn in patches, they just spawn alone now.
- Bonemeal a Chicory to get a Chicory Colony! This new plant will grow a root system below it which can be dug up for a new type of food. It'll also drop 2-3 Chicories when broken.
- Chicory Roots are a new food type that gives a new effect! This effect doesn't have a name yet but it'll allow you to eat food quicker.
- You can also ground Chicory Roots! Ground Chicory Roots can be made into Chicory Coffee.
# Meadows
- Meadows are a new biome (formerly known as the Nemophila Fields) filled with all sorts of blue flowers, including a new cyan Jacaranda variant.
- Of course, they've got plenty of Nemophilas! They've also got Blue Daisies and Myositis in them.
- Chicories spawn here in much larger patches, including some Colonies with root systems scattered throughout. So they act as a new food source in the Meadow.
- Some little birds might generate here as well. More on that in the future - we're not sure if they'll make it into this update yet.
# Redbud Groves
- Flowering Redbuds no longer generate in Lavender Fields. Instead, they've got their own new, semi-rare biome: the Redbud Grove!
- This biome is full of pink flowers and Redbud Trees of both kinds. So it's not exactly a cherry forest-type biome; it's a bit shrubbier and greener, and filled with flowering life.
- Additionally, Flowering Redbud Leaves now drop Pink Blossoms, which can be crafted into Pink Dye, or Pink Blossom Carpets that work the same way Lavender Blossom Carpets used to.
- Lavender Blossoms and Lavender Blossom Carpets have been removed as their function is now taken over by Pink Blossoms.
# Screechers
- Screechers are a new neutral mob that spawns in Lavender Fields and Forests. They've got biome variant skins for some of the most flowery biomes in the game: all Abundance biomes as well as Sunflower Plains.
- When provoked, Screechers will screech, giving nearby entities the Deafened effect, which makes you unable to hear ingame sounds.
- Screechers drop Screecher Tails when killed. These tails can be brewed into Potions of Deafening.
- he stride
